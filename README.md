# Premier-Soccer-Bot-League
Premier Soccer Bot League project involved designing, building, and competing with a custom soccer robot. Utilized SolidWorks for precision engineering, Arduino for control, and implemented innovative strategies in C++ for enhanced gameplay, securing second place in the competition.

# Premier Soccer Bot League Project

## Project Overview
This repository contains all the design files, code, and documentation for the Premier Soccer Bot League competition. Our team designed and built a soccer-playing robot that competed against others, securing second place out of seventeen teams.

## Design
The robot was designed using SolidWorks, focusing on durability and optimal movement strategies. The 3D models included in the `Designs` folder provide a detailed view of the mechanical components used.

## Control System
The control system was developed using an Arduino board, enabling real-time responsiveness and agility on the field. The code, available in the `Code` folder, includes motor control algorithms and Bluetooth connectivity setups for remote operation through a custom mobile app.

## Features
- **SolidWorks 3D models:** Detailed designs for each component of the soccer bot.
- **Arduino control code:** Scripts for motor control and Bluetooth communication.
- **Strategy implementation:** Advanced algorithms to enhance gameplay using C++.
